#### Introduction

This application was developed as part of a technical interview process during a recruitment drive. It serves as a comprehensive tool for curating exchange rates data from various API endpoints and delivering it to users for analytical purposes. The primary objectives of the development process were to fulfill the following requirements:

- Establish connectivity to any exchange rates API to retrieve data reflecting the exchange rates between Australia and New Zealand over the past 30 days, formatting it into JSON output.
- Implement preprocessing measures to address any anticipated data issues and ensure data quality.
- Conduct thorough data analysis, including identifying the best and worst exchange rates recorded within the specified time period, and calculating the average exchange rate for the month.

Additionally, the application incorporates a basic medallion architecture pattern and pipeline structure to enhance its coherence and efficiency.
